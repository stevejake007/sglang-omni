"""Regression test for the async-decode gate, and the home of its methodology.

The S1-S5 ON/OFF gate is a GPU integration harness (server launcher, dump and
counter hooks, concurrent driver, ABAB runner): it needs a live serving stack and
GPUs, so it cannot run in CI and lives as operational tooling off-tree. This
module is the in-repo source of truth for the gate: it absorbs the CPU-testable
essence (the scenario table, the comparison and counter logic) and records the
methodology those scenarios implement.

Methodology
-----------
Two-tier criteria. The gate compares the vocoder-entry ``audio_codes`` of an ON
arm (``--decode-mode async``) against an OFF arm (sync), per request, keyed by
seed. Only S1 is checked for exact bit-identity: it is ``bs=1`` with
``min_batch_size=1``, so it is both deterministic (a single request has no
batch-composition variance) and lookahead-forced, which is exactly why it is the
load-bearing anchor and the test that caught the real bs=1 stop-boundary bug. The
multi-request scenarios (S2 steady batch, S3a/S3b finish transitions, S4
retraction, S5 rep-penalty routing) are structural: no crash, every seed
produces a dump, the lookahead engaged, every request finished.

Why concurrency precludes multi-request bit-identity. Engaging the lookahead
needs a real batch, which needs requests sent concurrently; but then per-step
batch composition is timing-dependent, so the CUDA-graph bucket trajectory varies
run to run, perturbing the low bits of each request's hidden states, which the
binary stop head amplifies into different stop frames (different frame counts).
So exact bit-identity and real-concurrency lookahead coverage are mutually
exclusive for multi-request scenarios; only ``bs=1`` (S1) gets both.

OFF-vs-OFF empirical basis. This is not a lookahead defect: an OFF-vs-OFF control
(two pure-sync concurrent runs of the same seeds, zero lookahead) already differs
in frame count and values (e.g. seed 1002: 49 vs 36 frames; seed 1000: same frame
count, different values). A lookahead defect would instead show ON != OFF while
OFF-A == OFF-B. The raw drift dumps are retained off-tree for review.

Counter methodology. Concurrency is necessary but not self-evident, so every ON
arm also asserts the lookahead hit/miss counter (written from inside
execute_resolve): every lookahead scenario must show ``hit+miss > 0`` and the
rep-penalty scenario must show ``0`` (its batch routes wholly to sync). A
bit-identity match without engagement is not accepted, because a sequential
driver kept the server at ``bs=1`` (below ``async_decode_min_batch_size`` for
every scenario but S1), silently ran the ON arm through the sync fast path, and
"proved" bit-identity of sync against sync.

This test locks three things a refactor must not silently break: the criteria
tiering, that the rep-penalty scenario actually carries a penalty request (else
its ``counter == 0`` check is vacuous), and that the comparison flags shape AND
value drift while the counter assertion distinguishes engaged from sync-routed.
