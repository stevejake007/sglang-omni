"""Regression for review finding P2: stop without run_id was a no-op.

The original bug:

1. ``POST /start_request_profile`` with no ``run_id`` generates one of the
   form ``run_<timestamp>``.
2. ``POST /stop_request_profile`` with no ``run_id`` used ``"default"`` as
   the value to broadcast.
3. Each stage's stop handler only stopped when its active run id matched
   the message — so a default-value stop was silently dropped, and the
   recorder kept writing.

The fix makes ``ProfilerStopMessage.run_id`` optional. ``None`` is a
wildcard: stop whatever's active.
