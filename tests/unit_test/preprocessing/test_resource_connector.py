"""Unit tests for bare local paths in MultiModalResourceConnector.

Bare paths are a trusted-local convenience: they stay accepted when no
allowlist is configured, but once allowed_local_media_path is set they must
resolve inside it — the same policy file:// references follow.

The security invariant under test is that a rejected reference is never
passed to MediaIO. Rejection must happen before any I/O, not after, so every
reject case asserts both the raised error and that the recording MediaIO saw
zero load_file calls.
