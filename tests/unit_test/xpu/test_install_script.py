"""install_xpu.sh must never destroy the user's pyproject.toml.

The script swaps pyproject_xpu.toml over pyproject.toml and restores it from a
fixed backup path on exit. INT/TERM are trapped, but a SIGKILL, an OOM kill, or a
failed restore leaves the swap in place with the backup holding the only copy of
the original. Re-running then used to copy the already-swapped XPU manifest over
that backup, losing the original for good.
