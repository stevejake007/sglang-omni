"""Performance policy for the TTS MPS DP2 validation stage.

References are raw worst-of-five observations from a CI-comparable H100, held
pre-slack exactly as the external `calibrate-h100-ci` skill writes them. CI
assertion slack is derived here, never baked into the stored reference, so a
recalibration only ever rewrites the `_REF` literals.

`None` means the metric has not been calibrated yet. The stage still collects
and reports the observation, then fails the assertion, so an uncalibrated gate
can never pass silently.

Calibrated 2026-08-02 on one H100 of the CI host against SGLang 0.5.16, five
strict-valid repeats per stage at concurrency 16 over the full SeedTTS EN set
(run `20260802T033000Z_tts-mps_all_r8`); every metric held a spread under 3.1
percent.
