"""Native weight-share lifecycle smoke on one GPU.

Author: Jiaxin Deng

Codifies the ``--weight-share on`` contract end to end on real hardware. Two
same-GPU replicas of one pipeline are booted twice, unshared and shared, and the
card must end up holding materially less with sharing on: that is the whole
point of the feature, and it is measured rather than inferred from a log line.
The same run pins the spawn order that keeps a follower from deadlocking against
its leader, and a second case pins the failure mode operators will actually
meet, a leader that dies while followers hold its mappings, which must fail the
pipeline rather than serve aliased memory.

Quality and throughput are out of scope; this file exists so a lifecycle
regression fails a machine, not a user.

Not wired into a workflow yet; run manually on a GPU host:
