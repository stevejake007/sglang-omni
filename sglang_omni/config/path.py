"""Canonical configuration paths compiled from the typed pipeline schema.

A :class:`ConfigPath` is *compiled against the typed schema*, not evaluated
against a dict. That buys three things a dict walker cannot offer:

* an illegal path fails at parse time with nearby legal paths, instead of
  raising ``KeyError`` deep inside a ``model_dump()`` copy;
* every path knows its declared type, so a CLI string can be coerced by
  pydantic rather than by ``int()``/``float()`` guessing;
* every path knows whether it is part of the public surface, so derived
  values such as ``config_cls`` can be refused up front.

Stages are addressed **by name** (``stages.thinker.factory.max_seq_len``) and
compile against their *own* stage type: the root config class declares a
``StageConfig`` subclass per stage name, so a model-specific ``factory.*``
field exists only on the stage that declares it, and ``engine.*`` exists
only on stages whose type drives an SGLang engine. Positional indices are
not accepted anywhere.
