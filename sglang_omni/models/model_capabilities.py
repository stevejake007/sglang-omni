class ModelCapabilities:
    """Static capability declaration for a model architecture.

    These flags describe what a model architecture can support. Concrete
    checkpoint and deployment policy stays with ``PipelineConfig`` methods. For
    example, a Qwen3-TTS CustomVoice checkpoint can reject uploaded reference
    audio even though the architecture declares reference-audio support.

    Fields:
    - supports_reference_audio: the architecture can condition on reference
      audio when the selected checkpoint/deployment allows it.
    - supports_batch_vocoder: the architecture can produce batched waveform
      output.
    - supports_streaming_vocoder: the architecture can stream vocoder output
      before the full generation payload is complete.
    - supports_cuda_graph: the architecture has a CUDA graph path.
    - supports_torch_compile: the architecture has an owned ``torch.compile``
      path, including codec, codebook, or frame-sampler compiles. This is not
      limited to the generic SGLang ``enable_torch_compile`` server arg.
    - supports_breakable_prefill_cuda_graph: the architecture satisfies the
      breakable prefill CUDA graph contract through upstream-compatible inputs
      or model-specific adaptation; enabling it per deployment stays with the
      engine builder policy.
