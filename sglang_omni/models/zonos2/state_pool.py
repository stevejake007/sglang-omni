"""On-device per-request decode state for ZONOS2.

Each in-flight request holds a fixed row; per-step feedback, the EOS state
machine and the generation step live in pre-allocated GPU tensors indexed by
row, so the decode tail can update state as device math. Modelled on
``moss_tts_local.state_pool``. A reserved padding row (``P-1``) is never handed
out, giving graph replay a stable index for padded batch slots.
