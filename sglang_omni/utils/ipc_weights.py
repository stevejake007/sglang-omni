"""Same-GPU weight sharing over CUDA IPC for same-GPU data parallelism.

One replica per GPU is the LEADER: it loads checkpoint weights, serializes
CUDA-IPC handles for every parameter and buffer, and atomically publishes the
handle blob to a file. FOLLOWERS build the same module tree with dummy weights
(no checkpoint I/O), then alias every parameter and buffer onto the leader's
storage by assignment, not copy. KV cache, CUDA graphs, and sampler state stay
private per replica.

Tensors named by the architecture's WeightSharePolicy as replica-private are
the exception: a registered tensor a model writes per request (a decode
staging scratch) must never alias across replicas, so the leader ships it by
value and the follower copies into the storage its own module build created,
keeping the address its CUDA graphs capture. Both sides derive the
classification from the same audited policy and fail closed on any mismatch.

Ordering contract, enforced by the caller and verified here:

- The leader exports at the end of load_model. Builder-level hooks (e.g. Higgs
  truncate_rope_to_bf16) run later and mutate the already-shared storage, so
  they must stay in-place, idempotent, and deterministic: a follower's
  redundant application must write identical bytes.
- Followers attach before KV-pool profiling, warmup, and graph capture.
  verify_attachment re-checks storage identity right before capture, so a
  silently re-initialized tensor fails loudly instead of serving dummy weights.
- The leader must outlive followers, since CUDA IPC mappings die with the
  exporting process; restart replicas together.
- The store dir must be unique per run: an exclusive flock lease refuses a
  second live leader, and a recycled pid or a different checkpoint is caught
  on attach.

Role and store dir come from SGLANG_OMNI_WEIGHT_SHARE (leader:<dir> or
follower:<dir>) so supervisors stay declarative; unset means sharing is off.
Each engine reads and writes <dir>/<ModelClass>.weights-ipc so multi-engine
stages cannot clobber each other.
