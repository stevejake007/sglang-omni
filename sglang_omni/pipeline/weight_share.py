"""Runtime-owned leader/follower assignment for CUDA IPC weight sharing.

Replicas of one logical Process that land on the same physical GPU are a
sharing group: the lowest replica index loads the checkpoint and publishes
CUDA-IPC handles, the others alias them. This module only plans; the mechanism
itself lives in :mod:`sglang_omni.utils.ipc_weights` and is driven by the same
environment contract an external supervisor would use.

Planning happens in the parent, before the coordinator binds and before any
child is spawned, so an unusable configuration fails in milliseconds instead of
after a leader has loaded a full checkpoint.
