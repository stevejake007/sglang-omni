"""Graph capture for the model-owned graph paths, one backend per accelerator.

A model that captures its own graphs asks its platform for the backend instead of
naming torch.cuda. The graph object and the capture context's keywords differ per
accelerator, and SGLang resolves them explicitly for the same reason, so the
choice belongs on the platform rather than in a per-model branch.
