"""Deliver a stage's declared KV byte budget to its SGLang engine bootstrap.

A stage's ``engine.kv_cache_bytes`` must reach the KV-cache
configurator without threading a new keyword argument through every model's
factory and engine-builder signature. The stage worker scopes the budget
around the single factory invocation choke point, and
``create_sglang_infrastructure`` consumes it at the single engine construction
choke point, so model files need no per-model plumbing and a newly added model
is covered automatically.
